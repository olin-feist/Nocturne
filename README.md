# Nocturne
Nocturne is a mobile night time object detection and distance system built with the [Quartz64](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Quartz64) SBC and written entirely in C++.

## Overview
This project involves the development of a compact, integrated system that combines a single-board computer with a camera, display, and ultrasonic sensor. The system leverages TensorFlow Lite to perform real-time object detection and displays both the detected objects and a single point distance on a screen.

## Implementation Details

### Object Detection
Implemeted with [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) library and a quantized [Yolo V5](https://www.kaggle.com/models/kaggle/yolo-v5) model 

### Camera
Video feed fetched with the Linux userspace api, video for Linux. Image decoding and croping done with [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)

### Dipslay
Object detection info shown with SSD1306 display using I<sup>2</sup>C serial bus

### Distance sensor
Simple usage of ultrasonic senor with GPIO for communication
